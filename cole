				Bugatti was founded in 1909 in Molsheim, France.  It was founded by Ettore Buggati who was Italian.  When he died and his son died the company almost died with them.  They were purchased for their airplane parts business in the 1960's.  In the 1990's an Italian entreprenuer started making exlcusive sports cars after reviving the company.  As of today the main owner of Buggati is Volkswagen.
